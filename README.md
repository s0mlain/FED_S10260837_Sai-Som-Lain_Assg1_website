# The neighbourhood website

My overview of the website is for fans or potential fans who would like to know about the band and for fans who would like to
purchase the band's merchandise as well as for event organizer to contact them. The website has great user experience with
clear and straightforward navigation bars and links with any device compactibility. As for the visual design part I have 
made it a monotone theme which essentially matches the band's song genre.

## Design Process
As a fan of the band I would like to know more about the band as well as purchase their merchandise and find their social media
account. Secondly as a event organizer who wants the band to perfom at an event we would want to contact the band so I created an
contact form.

## Existing Features
Login Form - For people to create their accounts that would like to buy their merchandise or just for fun.
Hyperlinks to social media accounts - For people who would want to know the band's social media accounts.
Contact Form - For event organizers or fans who would like to contact the band.

## Features left to implement
Add to cart page - When you add an item to cart it leads you to another page that shows you an overview of your cart.
Payment page - To check out the items you have added in your cart.
News or Tour section - A page section where you can get to know where or when they are performing next.

## Testing
1. Contact form
   - CLick on the contact in the navigation bar
   - try to input an wrong form of email and verify that it shows an error message
